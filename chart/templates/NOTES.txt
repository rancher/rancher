Rancher Server has been installed.

NOTE: Rancher may take several minutes to fully initialize. Please standby while Certificates are being issued, Containers are started and the Ingress rule comes up.

Check out our docs at https://rancher.com/docs/

If you provided your own bootstrap password during installation, browse to https://{{ .Values.hostname }} to get started.

If this is the first time you installed Rancher, get started by running this command and clicking the URL it generates:

```
echo https://{{ .Values.hostname }}/dashboard/?setup=$(kubectl get secret --namespace cattle-system bootstrap-secret -o go-template='{{ "{{" }}.data.bootstrapPassword|base64decode{{ "}}" }}')
```

To get just the bootstrap password on its own, run:

```
kubectl get secret --namespace cattle-system bootstrap-secret -o go-template='{{ "{{" }}.data.bootstrapPassword|base64decode{{ "}}" }}{{ "{{" }} "\n" {{ "}}" }}'
```


Happy Containering!
