### Developing

In our GitHub [repository](https://github.com/rancherio/rancher), our wiki contains all the steps to get started with developing Rancher.

Start with our first [cowpoke](https://github.com/rancherio/rancher/wiki/Cowpoke-1:-Getting-Started-with-Rancher) to get started!

### Repositories

All of repositories are located within our main GitHub [page](https://github.com/rancherio). There are many repositories used for Rancher, but we'll provide descriptions of some of the main ones used in Rancher.

[Rancher Repo](https://github.com/rancherio/rancher): This repo is the main repo that integrates all the other repos together. 

[Cattle Repo](https://github.com/rancherio/cattle): This repo is where the functionality of Rancher is developed. 

[UI Repo](https://github.com/rancherio/ui): This repo is where all the UI for Rancher is developed. 

If you have any updates to our documentation, please make any PRs to the `gh-pages` branch in our main [Rancher Repo](https://github.com/rancherio/rancher) and contribute to that branch. 

### Bugs

If you find any bugs or are having any trouble, please contact us by filing an [issue](https://github.com/rancherio/rancher/issues/new). Though we have many repositories related to Rancher, we want the majority of the bugs in the Rancher repo so we won't miss them!
