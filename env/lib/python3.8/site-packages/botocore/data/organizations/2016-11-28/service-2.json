You can attach one SCP to a higher level root or OU, and a different SCP to a child OU or to an account. The child policy can further restrict only the permissions that pass through the parent filter and are available to the child. An SCP that is attached to a child can't grant a permission that the parent hasn't already granted. For example, imagine that the parent SCP allows permissions A, B, C, D, and E. The child SCP allows C, D, E, F, and G. The result is that the accounts affected by the child SCP are allowed to use only C, D, and E. They can't use A or B because the child OU filtered them out. They also can't use F and G because the parent OU filtered them out. They can't be granted back by the child SCP; child SCPs can only filter the permissions they receive from the parent SCP.</p> <p>AWS Organizations attaches a default SCP named <code>\"FullAWSAccess</code> to every root, OU, and account. This default SCP allows all services and actions, enabling any new child OU or account to inherit the permissions of the parent root or OU.
