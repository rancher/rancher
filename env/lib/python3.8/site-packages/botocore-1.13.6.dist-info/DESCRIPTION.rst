A low-level interface to a growing number of Amazon Web Services. The
botocore package is the foundation for the
`AWS CLI <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli>`__ as well as
`boto3 <https://github.com/boto/boto3>`__.

On 10/09/2019 support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 was deprecated and support
will be dropped on 01/10/2020. To avoid disruption, customers using Botocore
on Python 2.6 or 3.3 will need to upgrade their version of Python or pin the
version of Botocore in use prior to 01/10/2020. For more information, see
this `blog post <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/deprecation-of-python-2-6-and-python-3-3-in-botocore-boto3-and-the-aws-cli/>`__.
