# Rancher/SCC Telemetry Schemas

This directory contains the canonical JSONSchema's used to represent various SCC related telemetry objects.
These are objects that are specific to the product source the telemetry data comes from.
Eventually it may be wise to split this into it's own repo.

>[!NOTE]
> For now the only one that exists is Rancher, so it can live here with Rancher's Telemetry manager.
