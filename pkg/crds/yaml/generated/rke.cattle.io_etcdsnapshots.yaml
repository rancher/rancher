              name:

                  Name is the full snapshot name. It consists of the cluster name prefix,
                  followed by the base snapshot identifier and ends with an optional storage suffix (e.g. "s3").
                  The typical format is:
                    <cluster>-etcd-snapshot-<cluster>-<nodepool>-<uniqueid>-<timestamp>[-<storage-type>]
                  The base snapshot identifier follows:
                    etcd-snapshot-<cluster>-<nodepool>-<uniqueid>-<timestamp>

                  S3 holds metadata about the S3 destination if the snapshot is stored remotely. If nil, the snapshot
                  is assumed to be stored locally and associated with the owning CAPI machine.

                      If this field is not explicitly set, the 'defaultBucket' value from the referenced CloudCredential will be used.
                      An empty bucket name will cause a 'failed to initialize S3 client: s3 bucket name was not set' error.

                      or the CA certificate content, in base64-encoded or plain PEM format.
