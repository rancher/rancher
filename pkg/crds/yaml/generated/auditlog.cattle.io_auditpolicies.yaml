                  Filters described what logs are explicitly allowed and denied. Leave empty if all logs should be allowed. The
                  Allow action has higher precedence than Deny. So if there are multiple filters that match a log and at least one
                  Allow, the log will be allowed.

                        RequestURI is a regular expression used to match against the url of the log request. For exapmle, the Filter:

                        Filter {
                            Action: Allow.
                            REquestURI: "/foo/.*"
                        }

                        would allow logs sent to "/foo/some/endpoint" but not "/foo" or "/foobar".

              verbosity:
                description: |-
                  Verbosity defines how much data to collect from each log. The end verbosity for a log is calculated as a merge
                  of each policy that Allows a log (including plicies with no Filters). For example, take the two policie specs
                  below:

                  AuditPolicySpec {
                      Enabled: True,
                      Verbosity: LogVerbosity {
                          Request: Verbosity {
                              Body: True,
                          },
                      },
                  }

                  AuditPolicySpec {
                      Enabled: True,
                      Filters: []Filters{
                          {
                              Action: "allow",
                              RequestURI: "/foo"
                          },
                      },
                      Verbosity: LogVerbosity {
                          Response: Verbosity {
                              Body: True,
                          },
                      },
                  }

                  A request to the "/foo" endpoint will log both the request and response bodies, but a request to "/bar" will
                  only log the request body.
