          DynamicSchema is the definition of a schema. Dynamic schemas are
          created and used internally by Rancher to generate CRDs and API
          endpoints, and should not be created manually.

          DynamicSchema functionality for generating Rancher dynamic API
          endpoints is limited. These endpoints are not backed by any stores,
          and most related fields will not have any useful effect.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
