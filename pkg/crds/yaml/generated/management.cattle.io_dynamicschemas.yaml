          DynamicSchema is the definition of a schema. Dynamic schemas are
          created and used internally by Rancher to generate CRDs and API
          endpoints, and should not be created manually.

          Functionality for generating Rancher dynamic API endpoints is
          limited. These endpoints are not backed by any Norman stores, and
          most related fields will not have any useful effect.
